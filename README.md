The present work aims to demonstrate the potential of creating a neural network to predict the total organic content (TOC) based on the XRF results of cutting samples from a hydrocarbon source rock.
The database consists of 25 records of cutting samples from a source rock, originating from two drillings. It includes values for TOC and XRF elements such as Zr, Sr, Rb, Th, Pb, As, Zn, Cu, Fe, Mn, 
Ti, Ca, K, S, and Ba. The results obtained from the neural network are truly promising, with a highly accurate predicted TOC despite the limited number of records.
